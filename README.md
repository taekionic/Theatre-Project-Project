# Theatre Project Project
 Work I completed during an internship to add rental movie catalogue and blog comment features.
 
 Features I implemented during this project were: 
 
 1. A Rental Item model and a controller to facilitate the creation, cataloguing, and searching of rental movies for users. 
 
 2. A blog comment partial view utilziing AJAX to update likes/dislikes and reflect those changes on a ratio-bar.
